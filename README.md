# Metamask sign in with Firebase

This sample shows how to authenticate with a Metamask to Sign-In with Firebase. In this sample we use a basic authentication request with the supplied credentials and if successful create a Firebase Custom Token.

It's inspired by [Username/password sign in with Firebase](https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/Node-8/username-password-auth)

## Setup the sample

Almost same with [Username/password sign in with Firebase](https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/Node-8/username-password-auth)
